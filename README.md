 HTML and CSS work together to create both content and style on a website, where HTML structures the content, and CSS provides the visual design. 
 
  we work with external CSS files, which means that the CSS code is placed in a separate file (often with the file extension .css), separate from the HTML file. This provides a tidy codebase where the HTML file only contains HTML code, while the CSS file only contains **style rules.**
  
Although there are alternative ways to add CSS, such as inline CSS (directly inside the HTML element) and internal CSS (placed inside the <head> element), we avoid these. The reason for this is that by keeping the CSS separate, the code becomes more readable, reusable and easier to maintain, especially when working on larger projects.


To use **Flexbox**we must first specify display: flex; on the parent element, which then allows us to control how the child elements are placed. This means that we can center, adjust or distribute the elements in both vertical and horizontal directions. 

**Flexbox** thus gives us a number of practical tools for layout, but certain properties in CSS, such as justify-content and align-items, require Flexbox to be activated in order to function correctly.

**Task:**
Start creating a website that will be your portfolio, or home page. Where you can share information about yourself as a developer and the projects you have created.

Attached is an example of how this might look. The page should in no way be completely developed in this assignment, but I want you to start setting up a project with the knowledge you have so far with semantic HTML and the placement method flex.

**Claim:**

Set up a website with semantic HTML

Set up an external CSS file for all CSS

Set up text and images in the main element, which correspond to what you want the website to be about

Use the location method flex to set up locations for your elements in the main element

**Bonus:**

Set up the HTML and CSS of the header element, which corresponds to the rest of the page

Set up the HTML and CSS of the footer element, which corresponds to the rest of the page

Use the link I've shared to CSS Reference to find properties you can experiment with changing the appearance of

Take a look at the link I have shared called Flexboxfroggy which is a game with different levels that can help to understand the flex method
